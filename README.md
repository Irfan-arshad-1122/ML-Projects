**SMS Spam Classifier**
**Overview**
This project focuses on building a simple SMS spam classifier using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) text messages.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the SMS spam classifier is sourced from (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sms_spam). It consists of labeled SMS messages, where each message is classified as either spam or ham.

**Project Structure**
sms_spam_classifier.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Dependencies**
Make sure to have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Open and run the sms_spam_classifier.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.

Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the SMS spam classifier, and evaluate its performance.

**Results**
The trained model's performance metrics, such as accuracy and confusion matrix, will be displayed in the notebook. Users can analyze these results to understand the classifier's effectiveness.
